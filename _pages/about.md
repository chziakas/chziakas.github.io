I'm  pursuing my PhD in **Artificial Intelligence** at **Imperial College London**. My research interests include **learning in world models**, **test-time adaptability**, and **AI safety**.  I previously did research at Microsoft AI, focusing on post-training Copilot for tool use.

Before starting my PhD, I co-founded an LLM evaluation startup Athina AI (YC 23) and worked in data-science roles at Turo, BMW, and Amazon. Please feel free to reach out if you share similar research interests or would like to discuss transitioning from the start-up world to a PhD.
